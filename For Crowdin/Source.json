A volley of sensors screamed in my ears as a hairline fracture arced across my vision. \r\n\r\nThe hard shell of a monstrous “Whorl” nearly compromised my air lock. If I hadn't had a small tube of polymer sealant from the astrotrain I would not be recording this now. \r\n\r\nThese carapaced organisms propel themselves with some form of gas-propulsion. Despite their similar appearance to the nautili of old, they do not use a bellows-like system for locomotion, but a steady streaming of gas through their curling shell. I wonder if this heavy armor prevents them from attaining higher altitudes, constrained to hover among the land creatures.  \r\n",
        "Quick with his sword and quicker with his feet; the agility of these clay 'people' is unexpected with a form so roughly shaped. \r\n\r\nWhen faced with one of the few creatures here which I feel some humanity in, my aloneness closes in. Why do they have clay pots on their heads? Could it be protection from this cruel reality, or maybe just to hide the scars from this brutal planet.. \r\n",
        "The teleporter nearly launched me into a steaming dung heap. I could not have anticipated such an enormous beast being its source. More impressive than their rumbling bellows is the bighorn's charge. Their many tons of muscle produce a crushing slam of horn and matted hair. \r\n\r\nWhen they are not stampeding after me I have observed these monsters using their massive heads to bludgeon rocks and fight amongst themselves. How can they expend so much energy on fruitless activity? Are they merely trying to keep from freezing?   ",
        "The malware of our age! These mechanical parasites were probably lurking on the ship before the crash. Pirates will use these bugs to collect especially valuable cargo, redirect transmission signals, or even hijack ships. Spiders can be programmed with all kinds of malicious objectives. \r\n\r\nIn general they are quite difficult to find and eradicate on large vessels, but now that they're loose they seem to be able to operate outside their software. They have retained their defense capabilities, and are risky to engage. Though, I wonder, how long will they continue to run without access to an electrical grid? \r\n",
        "It is quite rare that I smell anything through my respirator. I could not have been prepared for how bizarre no longer having a sense of smell is.  However, there have been a rare few occasions when I caught some trace aroma- generally somewhat bitter on this planet, but I savor them greedily. \r\n\r\nWhen I encountered this gelatinous beast I was assailed by a sweet smell! A strangely fruity scent.. Oh, how it brings me back to a more innocent time! As I struck the congealed blimp of a creature it divided and seemed to gain energy. With each blow more of the saccharine odor escaped the monster. I must admit, I may have been overzealous in my attack..\r\n",
        "A deadly force, they rush at me mad with grief and rage. Parents will slam the ground; their only aim to crush the butcher of their offspring. Their powerful blows open great lashes in the quaking ground.\r\n\r\nThough my guilt almost stays my hand, I cannot let them keep me from surviving this nightmarish planet. I know it is impossible to quell their fury; so instead I must end it. \r\n",
        "Could this be a distant cousin of the Lemurians below? An ancient evolutionary leap? These airborne reptiles do not interact with the ground Lemurians except to harass them occasionally. Perhaps there is some kind of natural feud between the species? \r\n\r\nIt is the membranous skin that attaches their long arms to their body which enables their flight. Each wingtip culminates in vicious talons. When they come in flocks these winged Lemurians are capable of great carnage. \r\n",
        "A robot creature that assembles itself.. I have not seen them materialize other than when I unknowingly trigger their presence. I cannot believe this is indeed a machine- and yet it is made from some alloy and uses heavy artillery! Was this on the ship, or are these guards a naturally occurring 'species' here? My suit's scanners are unable to detect any manufacturers' signature.\r\n\r\nThey seem to be determined not to let me pass. They attack with unlimited focus.",
        "Seems to be very large version of the Lemurians; perhaps this great lizard is a queen? With similar armor and much thicker skin, it took much more to bring down this foe. She moves much slower and posses a powerful scorching blast.\r\n\r\nI would willingly give up some of my dwindling rations to explore the Lemurian tunnels unnoticed. My mind envisions great communal caverns and many spectacular subterranean dwellings. Do great legions of Lemurians walk under my feet?",
        "Archer Bug",
        "Such aggravating creatures! These insects come in droves- as a group their wings create a maddening whine. Even the other creatures seem disturbed by their presence. Though they are not particularly strong, the circling insects certainly frustrate me. \r\n\r\nA small amount of their projectile spit managed to penetrate one of the layers of my suit. It was extremely caustic. A festering rash has formed in the area, but doesn't seem to be spreading.  ",
        "Colossus",
        "A low groaning, lasting for a few days at least. From the relative safety of my drop pod I watched as a mountain rose to its knees, pushing itself up with arms of stone and dirt and twine. \r\n#The Colossus appears as a cousin of the Rock Golem and share many similarities, from its red gaze to its stocky stature. Around its feet many smaller golems rose, joining it. In what possible ways could conventional weapons help me?\r\n#I've begun to find a dark humor in the absolute overkill that I face. This is simply ridiculous.",
        "Wandering Vagrant",
        "Day 3. While looking through some wreckage of the old ship, I felt a hot sensation on my skin and a brilliant white flash. Over the horizon maybe 5 miles north I saw it, looming over the forest tops.\r\n#It must be the size of a house, this thing. A massive variant of the jellyfish seen earlier; this behemoth hovers in the air, searching for something. The gas used to propel this beast bend the trees below it flat. When it spotted its prey, it sent out six bioluminescent orbs, all crashing towards the ground and incinerating the target. \r\n#This Vagrant, as I've come to call it, seems to wander amidst the skies, followed by many jellyfish. On the occasion the clouds part, I swear I sometimes see hundreds of vagrants up there. What are they looking for?",
        "Magma Worm",
        "I've stumbled upon an old relic, notably with two distinct stone prongs. On approaching it it whirred to life, apparently charging up. This seemed to disturb something deep and violent below the ground..\r\n#The Magma Worm exploded out of the ground, knocking me off my feet. While I struggled with shell shock, I saw it arc through the sky, then plunge back into the ground with another bang. \r\n#Reaching about.. 200 meters, the worm moves extremely fast for its size. Permanently burning out of pores in its skin, the Magma Worm uses this flame as both a hunting tool and a way to melt through the ground quickly. Its small, beady eyes lurch around, looking for prey. With its massive size, the Magma Worm must either eat VAST amounts of food a day or hibernate for a very, very, very long time below ground.",
        "Could this be the architect of the smaller wisps? Perhaps this Ancient Wisp is the puppeteer behind the fiery masks harassing me thus far, or is he also a devilish device of something greater..?\r\n\r\nThe heat coming off the purple flames is extreme. Ferocious columns of lightning threaten to short-out my suit, or worse, turn me into a blistered husk. What fuels these violent, burning apparitions? \r\n",
        "Oh, why me? My heart stopped when this great Imp manifested in previously empty space. So many horrendous eyes. With a gaping scream the Imp lets out a deadly red vapor. Some type of laser also trails me. \r\n\r\nThis demon is just as baffling in its movements as the smaller one. Barely escaping the Imp's whipping grasp I landed a final blow. Its dying body split open at its meridian, displaying its innards like some ghastly flower. This monster is just as gruesome in death as it was in life.\r\n",
        "Could this be..? Tales I never believed recounted a horrible beast, fire incarnate. Scourge of another solar system, the Ifrit nearly wiped out an entire space colony before being chained and launched into the great black void. Supposedly the flaming jets that accompanied his roars could be seen for days as he drifted outwards. \r\n\r\nGreat towers, what must have been the containment structure used to trap this monster, prevent his escape even on this forsaken plane. The only explanation I have for my surviving this legendary encounter is his many years drifting in space and having been fettered in this unforgiving, frozen wasteland. \r\n",
        "Toxic Beast",
        "This goliath's body has been carved by this world, covered in numerous scars. The squealing queen had seen many battles. Her coarse hair growing in jagged patches between each old wound only increased her fearsome appearance. \r\n\r\nHot breath from the boar's massive nose fogged up my helmet so badly that it was a marvel I was able to evade her stomping hooves overhead. ",
        "Cremator",
        "I could not believe my eyes as this creature erupted from the lava. My suit's temperature gauges screeched in warning. How can anything subsist in such heat? The lava parts in waves as the monster swims rapidly through it. \r\n\r\nThrough craters in the Cremator's thick back armor red hot boulders explode in every direction. The amount of heat and pressure within its body must be a source of immense power. However, its head does not appear as well protected. I pray that it is a source of weakness, for if this leviathan bests me I know there will be no remains left to mark my short existence.\r\n",
        "Who knew a pack rat could be so dangerous! This creature seems to be hoarding many of the items littered across this planet. I have seen no others of its kind. If it hadn't been so intent on slaying me I would have tried to gain this Scavenger as an ally.. \r\n\r\nWill I ever see a friendly face again, or will my last breaths be on this hostile planet? \r\n",
        "I recognized him from the security footage... he was the one who blew the cargo hatches open. He was the one who killed everyone. \r\n#Providence, as I came to call him, moved faster and with more purpose than anything else I've seen on this planet. He must command great power, for he seemed to easily control two great gilded wurms of a species similar to the Magma Worm. Is he able to command everyone on this planet? I don't know his purpose, or his reasoning, but he did not give me a choice. I had to kill him... so why do I feel like I made a terrible mistake?\r\n#...Why did we have a teleporter from this planet in our cargo hold?",
